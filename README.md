# Hi there, I'm Jo Jo Monroe! ✨👋✨

Welcome to my world of creativity, technology, and transformation. 🌟 I value authenticity. I love exploring new ideas and find beauty in the journey. Whether it's building creative tech projects, exploring real estate investing, or applying creative makeup techniques — I'm here for it! 💄🏗️

## 💡 About Me

- 🎨 **Creative Enthusiast:** I'm deeply immersed in the beauty and wellness space, where creativity takes center stage. I love using makeup and style to express myself—there's nothing more powerful than transforming the way you look to embrace who you truly are.

- 💻 **Hands-On Tech Explorer:** I’m a practical, hands-on learner with a passion for real-world solutions. From Python projects to experimenting with AI, I'm always curious about technology and how it can make life better.

- 💼 **Entrepreneur at Heart:** I'm setting up a beauty boutique called "Just Kouture" that embraces individuality and celebrates authenticity. Just Kouture offers a diverse collection of wigs, clothing, accessories, featuring our signature  stylish human hair lace front wigs, clothing, and accessories—all designed to inspire confidence and self-expression. It's all about bold, unique styles that encourage self-expression and confidence, standing apart by offering high-quality, sustainable products that cater to diverse beauty needs. I believe business can be sustainable, creative, and inclusive—and I'm building something that reflects that vision.

- 🌸 **Wellness Advocate:** After a major life change through gastric sleeve surgery, I’ve transformed my health and embraced my true self. This transformation has fueled my passion for wellness, driving my work to help others take charge of their health and well-being. I’m exploring wellness trends, especially around gut health, the benefits of intermittent fasting, and the mind-body connection, and I want to empower others to take charge of their journey too.

- 🏡 **Learning Real Estate:** I've recently dived into the world of real estate investing. I'm fascinated by how properties shape our lives and how investing can provide financial freedom. It’s all about growth, stability, and a dash of adventure! ✨
